  On June 29, I finally decided to escape from my first major in Archive management of WHU to apply for Tsinghua University's School of Comuputer Science. 

  This is my first time to confront with so much pressure and uncertainty, I feel so nervous, anxiety and excited, because I know exactly I'm chasing my dream. I'm walking on the most correct way!

  However, life never lets me take a break. On making this decision, I suddenly realize it's such difficult work that I have to do lots of extra work for catching up with thoes deligent guys. Never mind Hancy, you still have many years to study. Since you're striking on the way you like, just stick to it!
